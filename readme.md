# ðŸ”’ Encrypted ShareX
Encrypted ShareX is a self-hosted node.js express-based file uploader designed for ShareX (A screenshot and file upload tool).
It utilises AES-256 encryption to encrypt files, and returns a randomised image name, and key to decrypt the image with. (Similar to https://mega.nz).

I am NOT a security expert, this is my first encryption project so probably isn't perfect, I welcome pull requests to improve security, but would like to avoid feature creep, or increase difficulty of use.

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible if there are issues with this project.
This project will not be secure if it's used on hosting that other people can access. And is only as secure as the server it's installed on.

## ðŸ’» Setup
This project is made in TypeScript using node.js 14.7 LTS, but may work with older versions.
